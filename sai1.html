<h3>Super Man</h3>

<p>I am a passionate Engineer with a degree in Electronics & Communication Engineering. My very first experience with code was at the time when I started my own blog. My struggle to customize the blog pages introduced me to HTML & CSS. Sooner, the excitment of having the power to structure pages on my own sounded amazing and thatâ€™s when I decided to purse Web development.</p>
<br>
<p>Recently, I learnt Full Stack Development. I have knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Java, C++ and Data Structures. Rational thought process and goal-oriented planning are my strengths.</p>
<br>
<p>I am currently on the look out for a challenging role to build products that make a difference.</p>
